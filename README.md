This is for capgemini tech challenge 2021 level 2
# Brief Summary :

## Problem Statement :

Develop an recommendation system from given dataset.


## Decription :

This is a website which has a built in recommendation system which works for all the users given in datset.

## How I implemented it in short :

1) Made use of HTML, CSS and Materialize CSS to design the structure of website.
2) Analyzed and cleaned data by using numpy and pandas and also finally with Dtale.
3) Made use of turicreate to create recommender models which is based on matrix factorization algorithm.
4) After testing out the system on colab made use of the same code in this django project. 
5) Each app is properly segregated into different apps considering a proper object oriented paradigm. 

## Steps to reproduce :

1) pip install every module mentioned in requirements.txt
2) python3  manage.py runserver 
3) There you go yay :) (A responsive system with recommender system integrated)

## Output :
